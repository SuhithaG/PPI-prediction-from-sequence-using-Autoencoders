# PPI-prediction-from-sequence-using-Autoencoders

"train_with_stacked_autoencoder.py" is the main script which trains and tests the data using Autoencoders. This scipt only uses Auto Covariance and Conjoint Triad Method to code the sequence.


All the supporting code for coding of protein sequence and the dataset is taken from "https://github.com/smalltalkman/hppi-tensorflow" as given in the paper "A novel conjoint triad auto covariance (CTAC) coding method for predicting protein-protein interaction based on amino acid sequence, Mathematical Biosciences, Volume 313, 2019, Pages 41-47, ISSN 0025-5564, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2019.04.002." 

The makefile and was modified in accordance to this project and only the files necessary for this project are present in this repo. For full code given the paper refer to this repo: "https://github.com/smalltalkman/hppi-tensorflow".
